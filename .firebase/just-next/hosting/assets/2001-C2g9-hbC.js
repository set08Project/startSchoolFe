bisyllabic (two syllable) words are usually stressed on the first syllable except the first syllable is a prefix.  example (DOCtor) is stressed on the first syllable but ''disprove'' is stressed on the second syllable because the first is a prefix, so it becomes (disPROVE). in the above question, all the options but ''saloon'' have a prefix. that means saloon has its stress on the first syllable.
