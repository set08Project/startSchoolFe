One of the rooms advertised itself as a living room. The kind earthenware pot willingly kept company with four ever-smiling stools. The pot eternally contained cool water for guests. The second room was a warm-hearted bedroom without a bed. The poor pair had to sleep on bare straw mats on the polished dirt floor. Some over washed rags deputized for blankets and sheets and pillows. Two strong dry logs, facing each other like bitter rivals burned themselves out at night, not merely to keep the couple warm but mainly to ward off hungry mosquitoes and other hostile pests.<br><br> There was no door to ward off the cold night air. Some rude \tdevices, however, were contrived to keep the room quite safe from prying eyes and curious domestic animals.
